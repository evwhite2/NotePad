# NotePad 

The NodePad application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Features for future development:

1. Updating UI for cleaner look, the tet boxes are a little wonky-looking, and I would like the "saved entries" on the left side to appear static once they are saved, then user can switch to an edit form with the addition of an "edit" button for each note.

2. I had issues I was not able to yet resolve pertaining to the modularization of the jquery inside the script tags of notes.html. I would like to further modularize each of my scripts into more self-contained units.
