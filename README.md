# NotePad 

The NodePad application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Features for future development:

1. Implmenting route/functionality to delete notes.
2. Auto-refreshing the page with new notes the moment "save" button is clicked. Currently I have an issue I cannot figure: I have to restart the server in order to populate any notes that may have been added since it was first started up.
