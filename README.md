The NodePad application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Deployed on Heroku at: https://notepad-2019.herokuapp.com/ 

Features for future development:

1. Updating UI for neater look, I would like the "saved entries" on the left side to appear static once they are saved

2. Update button should appear and function for each note
